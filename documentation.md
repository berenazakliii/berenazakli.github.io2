# Big idea notes
**COLLABRATƒ∞ON**

*Computing innovation can be improved through collaboration. A computing innovation is the creation and application of novel ideas, technologies, and approaches within the field of computing, it includes a program as an integral part of its function. Effective collaboration results in a computing innovation that reflects the diversity and the unique perspectives of those who designed it, it also helps avoid bias in the development of computing innovations. While developing computing innovations, consultation and communication with users are important aspects of the development. Some common models of types of collaboration are pair programming, think-pair-share and etc‚Ä¶ Collaboration can be supported by online tools such as github, repl it and shared doc/folder.*

**PROGRAM FUNCTƒ∞ON AND PURPOSE**

*The purpose of computing innovations is to usually solve a problem or pursue an interest through creative expression. A program is a collection of program statements that run different tasks when it's run by a computer. A program works with lots of inputs and outputs that determine the behavior of a program. The behavior of a program is how a program functions during execution. Program inputs are data sent to a program, it can come from a user or other programs. Outputs are data sent from a program to a device, output is usually based on a program's input of prior state.*

**PROGRAM DESƒ∞GN AND DEVELOPMENT**

*Creators usually develop a program using a development process.A development process can be ordered and intentional, or exploratory in nature. The development process that is incremental breaks the problem into smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before bringing them all together. While a development process that is iterative requires  revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. Investigation in a development process is important for understanding program constraints. ƒ∞nvestigation can be performed as user testing, interview etc‚Ä¶ The design phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification, it can look like brainstorming ,planning and storyboarding. Documentation is also really important, program documentation helps in developing correct programs when working in programming environments.*


**IDENTƒ∞FYƒ∞NG AND CORRECTƒ∞NG ERRORS**

*There are lots of errors we can face while creating a program. A logic error is a mistake in the algorithm/program that causes the program to fail. Some of these errors are called syntax error, run-time error or an overflow error. Some effective ways to find and correct errors are test cases, hand tracing debuggers etc.. ƒ∞n the development process testing uses defined input to make sure a program does not fail, defined inputs used to test a program should demonstrate the different expected outcomes. Program requirements are needed to find appropriate defined inputs for testing.*


# üê∏ Clock Game ‚Äì Frog Escape Edition

## What was the hardest part of timing logic?
Handling the `Timer` properly ‚Äî especially invalidating it to prevent overlap when restarting ‚Äî was tricky. Making sure time resets and updates visually with animation was also a challenge.

## How did you use `if`, `for`, and `functions`?
- Used `if/else` in `initialTimeForLevel(level:)` to adjust time based on level.
- Used `for` loop in console testing (see below).
- Functions organized logic: `startGame()`, `checkCollision()`, `nextLevel()`.

## What happens when your clock overflows?
When time reaches 0 or player hits an obstacle, the clock resets and prints a message. Game state is reset, and timer stops until the player presses restart.

# üç¶ Ice Cream Overflow

This is a simple SwiftUI game where you stack scoops of ice cream. You can add up to 3 scoops. If you try to add more ‚Äî it overflows!

---

##  Reflection

###  What is overflow in your app?
Overflow happens when you add more than 3 scoops. The app shows a message saying it‚Äôs too many scoops and stops you from adding more.

---

### How does the cone show abstraction?
The cone is a triangle shape. Instead of drawing every part, I used a simple `Triangle` shape. That‚Äôs abstraction ‚Äî using one shape to stand for something more complex.

---

###  What did you learn about binary & compression?
I learned that computers use 1s and 0s (binary) to store things like colors and scoop positions.  
Compression means saving space ‚Äî like reusing the same code instead of writing it again and again.
